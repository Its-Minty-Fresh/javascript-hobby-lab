                <h3>Introduction</h3>

                <p>I don't have any really exciting hobbies, but I am proud of my dog Toby!
                    <br><br>
                   I adopted him a couple years ago from the Humane Society and have worked hard to train him well
                   and teach him lots of tricks. he is great at loose leash walking (walking by your side without
                   getting head of you or pulling on the leash), and can be off-leash since he has developed
                   excellent recall.
                <br><br>
                    In fact I did my Intro to Web Development <a href="https://lucid-poitras-1dcd3c.netlify.app/index.html">Final Project</a>
                    on him just this past term!

        <h3>Did you know?</h3>

        <p class="did-you-know">The Humane Society does not tell adopting parents the breed of the dog they are adopting.
           The reason being many people will refuse to adopt specific dogs based on the breed alone, not the personality and
            temperament of the dog. Other times they may not even know!
